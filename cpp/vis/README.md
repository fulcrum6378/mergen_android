## VIS: Vision

Vision is, without doubt, the most crucial sense (data input) of an intelligent being
for their knowledge and information to be based upon.

Mergen uses the default color model outputted by many cameras called [**Yâ€²UV**](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%E2%80%B2UV), instead of RGB or etc.
In terms of hexadecimal, *YUV* is no different from [YCbCr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCbCr).

This component contains the following steps:

1. [**Camera**](camera.cpp) : responsible for dealing with Android's camera API,
   reading image frames and passing them onto the next step. This step is platform-specific.

2. [**Segmentation**](segmentation.cpp) : it divides an image frame into numerous segments
   and performs some kinds of analyses on some or all of them.

   Translated from *MyCV*'s [**Region Growing 4**](
   https://github.com/fulcrum6378/mycv/blob/master/segmentation/region_growing_4.py) and [**Comprehender**](
   https://github.com/fulcrum6378/mycv/blob/master/tracing/comprehender_rg4.py).

3. [**VisMemory**](memory.cpp) : it stores specific shapes for learning.

#### Other classes and procedural files

- [BitmapStream](bitmap_stream.hpp) : it stores image frames in BMP image format for testing in *MyCV*.
- [Colouring](colouring.hpp) : it makes a very simple effect in the UI of the Android app,
  indicating pleasure (in green) or pain (in red). (subclass of [Criterion](../rew/criterion.hpp))
- [Segment](segment.hpp) : it defines a Segment and type of path points in it.
- [VisualSTM](visual_stm.cpp) : *Visual Short-Term Memory*; it stores shapes (segments)
  temporarily on a non-volatile (persistent) memory for debugging.
